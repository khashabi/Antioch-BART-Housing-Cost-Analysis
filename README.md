# Housing Affordability Analysis — Antioch BART Station Area
### Project Overview

This project examines housing affordability patterns and change over time in the area surrounding the Antioch BART station, using spatial and census-based analysis to evaluate how affordability has evolved in relation to regional access and development. The work focuses on identifying trends, spatial disparities, and policy-relevant insights through geospatial data analysis and visualization.

The complete analysis, results, maps, and narrative discussion are presented exclusively in the ArcGIS StoryMap linked below and should be considered the primary project deliverable.
