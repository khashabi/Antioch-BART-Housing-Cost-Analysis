In reality, external factors and data limitations will limit our ability to attribute causality, but it will still be useful to analyze correlation. In the cells below, we add the necessary synthetic variables: Distance and distance_mi calculate how far the centroid of each tract is from the station, post (0 or 1) to signify whether or not the observation is before or after 2018, treat (0 or 1) for whether the distance is under 2 miles from the stations, and treat_post (treat*post) which tell us whether an observation is in the treatment AND post group.\n","\n","  We then run a regression predicting percentage of households with GRAPI 35 or greater based on treat, post, and treat_post.
